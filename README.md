## Exploratory Data Analysis Week 1 Project
*****

This assignment uses data from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php), a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, we will be using the "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set" which I have made available on the course web site:

* **Dataset**: Electric power consumption [20Mb]
* **Description**: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.
